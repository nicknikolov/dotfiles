# dotfiles

Originally, this was a fork of [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) but it kind of evolved into my own thing. It's not super forkable unless you are me since it's super customized and not indented to be flexible. But still, if someone would want to have this, `script/bootstrap` install everything needed. This is meant to be used on OSX and Ubuntu and some of the bootstrapping scripts won't work on non-Debian distros.
